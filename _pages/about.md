I am a Professor of Complex Systems at University of Sussex.  My work lies at the intersection of mathematics (dynamical systems, random processes, graph/network theory), engineering (control theory, signal processing, robotics) and neurophysiology (EEG, EMG, MEG, kinematics). Most of my current research focuses on **dynamical processes on networks**, be it synchronisation of neuronal activity in health and disease, epidemics on structured networks, or fault events in large-scale computer networks. My research typically involves developing analysis methods and/or mathematical results. I am (or have been) funded by various bodies including the Leverhulme Trust, InnovateUK, and industrial partners. I am a Honorary Associate Professor at the UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital Institute of Child Health.
